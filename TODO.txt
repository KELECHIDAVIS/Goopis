things to add later :
Additional Improvements to Consider
1. Three-fold Repetition Detection
You'll need to add position hashing (Zobrist hashing) to detect repeated positions:
c// Pseudo-code
if (positionRepeatedThreeTimes(board)) {
    return DRAW_SCORE;
}


1.5 : through zobrist hashing, add transposition tables to memoize calculated board positions we've already seen when searching moves
1.6: will continue transposition tables 
**can also add transposition tables to perft but not neccessary 

2. Insufficient Material
Detect positions where neither side can mate (e.g., K vs K, K+B vs K):
cif (hasInsufficientMaterial(board)) {
    return DRAW_SCORE;
}
